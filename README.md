RoadRush is a ReactNative mobile app created to streamline taxi services by eliminating middlemen. Built on the Evernode platform, it seamlessly embodies the 'middleman-be-gone' philosophy through its distributed network system.

Trip fares are calculated in USD for clarity, with wallet transactions converted to the equivalent EVERs amount. All transactions occur securely through individual Xaman wallets.

Data is securely stored within Evernode's distributed network for reliability and security.

Unlike other top taxi apps, RoadRush doesn't tack on extra fees since there's no middleman involved. This allows us to offer competitive prices, augmented by the integration of cryptocurrency wallets.

RoadRush is a mobile app made for giving taxi services to the community, focusing on cutting out middlemen. By building it on the Evernode platform, we easily embraced this idea with its built-in distributed network system.
 
Compared to other top taxi apps, RoadRush doesn't mention charging extra fees because there's no middleman overseeing the system like most others. This means we can offer lower prices, and adding cryptocurrency wallets makes us more competitive.
 
All the data is kept safe on the Evernode network, and integrated wallet accounts handle all the transactions done through the app.
